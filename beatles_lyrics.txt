Yesterday
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm

Let It Be
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be, yeah

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be

In My Life
There are
places I remember
All my life, though some have changed (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are
dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of
all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And these
memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Though I
know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I
know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more

Eleanor Rigby
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

Something
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile, she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now, it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Blackbird
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of a dark, black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of a dark, black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise

You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

A Day in the Life
I read the news today, oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four)
(*Alarm clock rings*)
[Bridge: Paul McCartney,
John Lennon & Paul McCartney
]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I read the news today, oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four)

I Am the Walrus
I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly, I'm cryin'

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run, I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin'

Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man (Now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (A poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus
Goo goo goo joob (Good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob

Don't you think the joker laughs at you?

See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snied, I'm cryin'

While My Guitar Gently Weeps
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still, my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still, my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still, my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Across the Universe
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

Strawberry Fields Forever
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one, I think, is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
(Two, three, four, four)

Always, no, sometimes, think it's me
But you know, I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean—er—yes, but it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Yellow Submarine
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mister Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us (
Every one of us
) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (
Sky of blue
) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (
In our yellow

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high (Ah)

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

When I’m Sixty-Four
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Oooh, you'll be older too  (Aaaah)
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer, we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (We shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four? Woo

I Want to Hold Your Hand
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I wanna hold your hand

I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

Oh, please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand

Now, let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that, my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you
Got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll
Say that something
I want to hold your hand

I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that, my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you
Got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll
Feel that something
I wanna hold your hand

I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

-----

I Will
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last, I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Da da da da da da da

Maxwell’s Silver Hammer
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)

P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)

I Saw Her Standing There

Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another?
Ooh, when I saw her standin' there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Woo, when I saw her standin' there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
[Verse 3: Paul McCartney &
Paul McCartney & John Lennon
]
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Woo, since I saw her standin' there

When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Rocky Raccoon
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day, his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day, he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, ow!

Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dooroo-do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do

Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Oh, dou-dou-dou)
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt (Ooh Rocky, ooh)
To help with good Rocky's revival, ow
Oh yeah, yeah

Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
C'mon, Rocky boy
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
C'mon, Rocky boy
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Yeah, come on, let’s Rocky it at the top

A Hard Day’s Night
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on Earth should I moan?

You know I feel okay

Happiness Is a Warm Gun
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

(Down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Chorus: John Lennon,
Paul McCartney & George Harrison

Happiness is a warm gun (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

When I hold you in my arms (Ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (Ooh, oh, yeah)
Because

(Happiness) 
Is a warm gun, mama 
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes, it is
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

Penny Lane
In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

And still, they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

Octopus’s Garden
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the seabed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you

In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch

(Number nine) Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number (Number, number nine, number nine)

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

Number nine, number nine
Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
With the situation
They are standing still
Upon the telegram
Ooh, ooh

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son, he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

So the wife called me, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
Block that kick, block that kick!
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah

How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Industrial output
Financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi
The Twist
El Dorado
Take this brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!

All My Loving
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow, I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away

You Never Give Me Your Money
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags, get in the limousine
Soon, we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven

Two of Us
I Dig a Pygmy
by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

We're going home
You better believe it
Goodbye

Tomorrow Never Knows
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning

I’m So Tired
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder, should I get up
And fix myself a drink?
No, no, no

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder, should I call you?
But I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
(Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur)
(How about another one?)

Getting Better
It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (Now, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (Now, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

Getting so much better all the time

Carry That Weight
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Love is you

Because the sky is blue
It makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way, Mr. K. will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight, Mr. Kite is topping the bill

She’s Leaving Home
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
[Chorus: Paul McCartney &
John Lennon
]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock, she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years

She's leaving home (Bye-bye)

-----

And I Love Her
I give her all my love, that's all I do
And if you saw my love, you'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

-----

For No One
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone, but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

She Came in Through the Bathroom Window
Oh, listen to that now
Heh, heh, heh, heh
Oh look out! He's c-

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

Oh, yeah

If I Fell
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you, oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So, I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain

Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

Till There Was You

But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all

Fixing a Hole
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right, where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right, where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah

Glass Onion

The walrus was Paul

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah

Within You Without You
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share, when we find it
To try our best to hold it there, with our love
With our love, we could save the world if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people, who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

Lady Madonna
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round

Oh, 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Oh, 'round, 'round, 'round...

Got to Get You into My Life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you, I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly, I see you
Did I tell you I need you?
Every single day of my life?

I’m Only Sleeping
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me (Ooh-ooh)
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am (Ooh, woo-ooh)
I'm only
sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day (Woo)
I'm miles away
And after all (Ooh, woo-ooh)
I'm only
sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please, don't spoil my day (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm miles away
And after all (Ooh, woo-ooh)
I'm only
sleeping

(*Yawns*)

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am (Ooh, woo-ooh)
I'm only
sleeping

We Can Work It Out
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

The Ballad of John and Yoko
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, “You've got to go back”
You know, they didn't even give us a chance

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Finally, made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say, “You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “We're only trying to get us some peace”

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said, “Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul”
Think!

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a
bag
The newspaper
said
, “She's gone to his
head
They look just like two gurus in
drag
”

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, “We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back”

Christ,
you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun

Morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart

Silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart

Coconut fudge - really blows down those blues (Woo!)

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

But what is sweet now turns so sour

Lovely Rita
Ah
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark, I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap, she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me?
(Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)
Got the bill and Rita paid it (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)
Took her home, I nearly made it (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)

Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone, I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"?
Gather 'round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

Piggies
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!

Everywhere, there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents
He always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed
Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Eyup!

Run for Your Life
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life trying
Just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

And Your Bird Can Sing
Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get
me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see
me

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there isAnd your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

Flowing more freely than wine

Revolution 1
Take two
Okay

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right

Real Love
[Verse 1: John Lennon &
John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for
you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all we really were doing
Was waiting for love

No need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

No need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for
you

No need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love, yes, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love

I’ve Just Seen a Face
I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm

Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is, I'll dream of her tonight
La-di-di-di'n'di

Fallin', yes, I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

I have never known the like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this

I’m Looking Through You
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed, you changed

Hey Bulldog

Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doin' it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Childlike
No one understands
Jackknife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (Yeah?)
Walking in the park

Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in youYou think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me

Good Morning Good Morning
(*Rooster crowing*)
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Good morning, good morning
Good morning

Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

After a while, you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Good morning, good morning
Good morning

People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town, it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay

Good morning, good morning, good

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja! Ja!)

Rain
If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines, they slip into the shade (When the sun shines down)
And sip their lemonade (When the sun shines down)
When the sun shines
When the sun shines (Sun shines)

Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain (When the rain comes down)
Everything's the same (When the rain comes down)
I can show you
I can show you (Show you)

Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

Can you hear me that when it rains and shines (When it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind (When it rains and shines)
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? (Hear me)

Honey Pie
She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A.​
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say

Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So, won't you please come home?

Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah

I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee

Now, Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So, won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me, Honey Pie

Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey Pie

I’ll Follow the Sun
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Some day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now, the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh-oh

One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Love You To
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to

Mother Nature’s Son
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting, singing songs

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music
As she flies

Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do

Find me in my field of grass

Swaying daisies, sing a lazy song
Beneath the sun

Cry Baby Cry
Cry, baby, cry

Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

At twelve o'clock, a meeting 'round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry, cry, baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry
Cry and cry and cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, (She do) she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird, I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so—

John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be

Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (To make a reservation)
Roll up for the mystery tour

The magical mystery tour
Is coming to take you away
Coming to take you away
The magical mystery tour
Is dying to take you away
Dying to take you away
Take you today

If I Needed Someone
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone

Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah

I Should Have Known Better
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa-oo-oh-oo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see? Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh-oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love, you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey, hey, hey, give me more

Whoa-oo-oh-oo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see? Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh-oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

Think for Yourself
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

P.S. I Love You

Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Keep all my love forever

You, you, you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Treasure these few words 'til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

As I write this letter (Oh)
Send my love to you
(You know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always (Yeah)
Be in love with you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

You, you, you
I love you

Don’t Pass Me By
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

-----

I Need You
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me, I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you

I need you
I need you

-----

I Want to Tell You
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next
time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up, but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes, I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up, but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

I've got time
I've got time

For You Blue
(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members)

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment, I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
(Bop, bop cat bop)
(Go, Johnny, go)
(Them ol' twelve-bar blues)
(Elmore James got nothing on this, baby)

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I'm livin' the blues

One After 909
My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said, "Move over, honey, I'm traveling on that line"
I said, "Move over once, move over twice"
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Pick up my bags, run to the station
Railman said, "You've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over, honey, I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 909, yeah

Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over, honey, I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna calling

I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so

I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so

She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm

Baby says she's mine, you know

This Boy
That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but, oh, my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

It’s Only Love
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Yes, it's so hard loving you
Loving you

You Really Got a Hold on Me
I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby!

I don't want you, but I need you
Don't want to kiss you, but I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby!

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me...
Tighter!
Tighter!

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh
I want to split now, I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me), baby! (Baby!)

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me (Please), hold me (Squeeze), hold me, hold me...

You've really got a hold on me (You've really got a hold on me)

A Taste of Honey
A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again

A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart

That taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back) for the honey (For the honey) and you

I’m a Loser
I'm a
loser
I'm a
loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask, I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

No Reply
This happened once before when I came to your door, no reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me 'cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone, they said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been, I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man in my place

If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before, when you gave me no reply

I tried to telephone, they said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been, I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man in my place

No reply, no reply

Roll Over Beethoven
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I've got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught it off the writer
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over, Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over, Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

Well, early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle, diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she winks like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
As long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

Maggie Mae
Oh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away

Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

What can I do?
Can't help myself

'Cause, baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)

The Word
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

In the beginning, I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Everywhere I go, I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love

It’s All Too Much
To your muff!

It's all too much
It's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere and get me home for tea

It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We all get too much

Too much, too much, too much
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a, too much-a, too much-a
Too much-a
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much

Wait
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though you ought to know

Old Brown Shoe
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey

For your sweet top lip, I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you

Misery
The world is treating me bad, misery

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her, I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her, I will be in misery (Oh, oh, oh)
In misery (Ooh, ooh)
My misery (La, la, la, la, la, la)
Misery

Rock and Roll Music
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit, they had a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South, they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks, they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a Tango
And in the mood, they take a Mambo
It's way too early for a Congo
So keep a-rocking that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

What Goes On
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you (Ooh)
As I walked along the road (Ooh)
But when I saw him with you (Ooh)
I could feel my future fold (Ooh)
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning (Ooh)
Waiting for the tides of time (Ooh)
But now the tide is turning (Ooh)
I can see that I was blind (Ooh)
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no one else (Ooh)
But you were just the same (Ooh)
You didn't even think of me (Ooh)
As someone with a name (Ooh)
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
(In your mind, in your mind)

Act Naturally
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Things We Said Today
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow, I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind

We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say

Ask Me Why
I love you 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show that I know
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why if I cry
It's not because I'm sad but you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

Ask me why, I'll say I love you and I'm always thinking of you, hoo, hoo, hoo

Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

That if I ran away from you
That you would want me, too
But I got a big surprise
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before?)

When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry!

All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

If it's something that I said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on

Only a Northern Song
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare, or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there

-----

All I’ve Got to Do
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I got to do

All I got to do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin' you

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me

And when I, I want to kiss you, yeah
All I got to do

I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me

Don’t Bother Me
Since she's been gone, I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see

So, go away, leave me alone, don't bother me

I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here, please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here, please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me

Don't bother me

Devil in Her Heart
(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, this, I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

Oh, no, no, no, this, I can't believe

The Inner Light
Without going out of my door

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

What You’re Doing
Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

Please stop your lying
You got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Tell Me What You See
If you let me take your heart, I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?

I’ll Cry Instead
I've got every reason on Earth to be mad
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do, you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there

You Like Me Too Much

You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely, which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do
And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

Bad Boy
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Ooh!

Ooh!
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat

Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself

No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
17:02 - 17:07
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
17:07 - 17:12
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.

Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!

- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
18:02 - 18:06
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
18:06 - 18:10
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
18:10 - 18:15
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
18:15 - 18:17
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!
18:17 - 18:20
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?

That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?

Very nice he was, too.
18:26 - 18:39
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
18:39 - 18:42
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
18:42 - 18:44
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
18:44 - 18:47
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
18:47 - 18:49
Is this ring nasty, sir?
18:49 - 18:55
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
18:55 - 18:59
Oh! That's better.

Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
(Laughs)
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
(Whirring)
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
(Whirring)
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
(Laser Beeps)
27:35 - 27:38
(Bang)
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.
30:03 - 30:07
No! it is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
30:07 - 30:10
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
30:24 - 30:32
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
30:32 - 30:35
(Soft clang)
30:35 - 30:39
(Ahme) 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
30:39 - 30:45
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
30:45 - 30:48
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
30:48 - 30:49
Don't look.
30:49 - 30:55
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
30:55 - 31:05
(Birds chirp)
31:05 - 31:08
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
31:08 - 31:21
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
31:21 - 31:23
There might be some insurance.
31:23 - 31:26
I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
31:26 - 31:28
What did you say that stuff is?
31:28 - 31:32
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. It's a minor medical secret.
31:32 - 31:35
I'm sure there's no call for all this.
31:35 - 31:39
I'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.
31:39 - 31:42
- Gum?
- Are you sure its not or habit forming?
31:42 - 32:03
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
32:03 - 32:06
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.
32:06 - 32:15
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.
32:15 - 32:17
Kaili.
32:17 - 32:20
Kaili. Kaili.
32:20 - 32:25
I promise you
the effect is purely transitory.
32:25 - 32:26
It wears off very quickly.
32:26 - 32:31
(Doorbell rings)
(Ahme) Don't answer it! It's Clang.
32:31 - 32:33
(Hollering and knocking)
32:33 - 32:37
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
32:37 - 32:38
(Hollering)
32:38 - 32:41
(Ringo) Come on, my finger!
32:41 - 32:43
Where's Paul?
32:43 - 32:48
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.
32:48 - 32:50
Where's he gone?
32:50 - 33:13
- Where are you, Paul?
- It's his best suit.
33:13 - 33:19
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.
33:19 - 33:24
(Baby crying)
33:24 - 33:26
- Standby.
- (Whispers) Standby.
33:26 - 33:29
Look out!
They're coming through the door!
33:29 - 33:35
(Knocking)
33:35 - 33:41
- Go!
- Go!
33:41 - 33:49
(Yells) Kaili!
33:49 - 33:55
Kaili... Oh!
33:55 - 34:00
- Sorry, I hit him.
- Oh!
34:00 - 34:03
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.
34:03 - 34:08
Kaili! Kaili!
34:08 - 34:13
(Gasps) Get off!
34:13 - 34:16
- It's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.
34:16 - 34:21
Well, stop it!
34:21 - 35:02
Feet! Feet, you fool!
35:02 - 35:13
(Growls)
35:13 - 35:19
(Sobs)
35:19 - 35:25
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!
35:25 - 35:34
(Gunshot)
35:34 - 35:37
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
35:37 - 35:40
Up!
35:40 - 35:42
Up, up, up!
35:42 - 35:44
- You!
- Which one has the ring?
35:44 - 35:46
That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
36:09 - 36:11
No, I could not.
36:11 - 36:15
I can't get it off.
36:15 - 36:18
(Squelch)
36:18 - 36:20
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
36:20 - 36:24
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
36:24 - 36:27
I shall have to operate.
36:27 - 36:29
It'll be on the National Health,
won't it?
36:29 - 36:33
- (Whooshing)
- Look!
36:33 - 36:36
Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!
36:36 - 36:39
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.
36:39 - 36:43
I'm glad it wore off quickly.
36:43 - 36:46
What are you doing here?
36:46 - 36:51
- (Hammer clicks)
- Get out!
36:51 - 36:55
British, you see! Useless.
If I had a Luger...
36:55 - 36:59
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.
36:59 - 37:09
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.
37:09 - 37:15
- Where's Ahme?
- I don't know.
37:15 - 37:23
(Speaks in Eastern language)
37:23 - 37:28
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:28 - 37:31
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.
37:31 - 37:34
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:34 - 37:37
I don't understand a word.
I don't speak the language.
37:37 - 37:40
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.
37:40 - 37:58
Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.

- It's them.
47:09 - 47:12
- Only me and Paul know we're here.
- I know.
47:12 - 47:18
Allow me. I'm a bit of a famous mimic.
You know... James Cagney.
47:18 - 47:21
(Liverpool accent)
Hello, this is the famous Ringo,
47:21 - 47:24
what is it that I can do for you?
47:24 - 47:26
Not a bit like Cagney.
47:26 - 47:30
- (Clang) 'Go to the window.'
- Hey, it is them!
47:30 - 47:32
(Clang) 'Go to the window.'

Right, lets get going.

69:04 - 69:07
We're not going there.
69:07 - 69:11
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
69:11 - 69:15
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
69:15 - 69:17
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
69:17 - 69:33
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.

Open that rock!
74:08 - 74:10
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
74:10 - 74:13
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
74:13 - 74:17
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
74:17 - 74:19
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
74:19 - 74:23
- Whats this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
74:23 - 74:26
You don't go for all that,
do you?
74:26 - 74:28
Keeps you busy, eh?
74:28 - 74:32
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.
74:32 - 74:33
(Hollering)
74:33 - 74:36
I don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
74:36 - 74:41
- In here, quick.
- (Ringo) I can't swim.
74:41 - 74:50
I'm not going!
74:50 - 75:10
Where have they gone?
75:10 - 75:12
- Lets go back and get them!
- I'm game.
75:12 - 75:16
- Lets smash them!
- Lets find that temple.
75:16 - 75:20
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
75:20 - 75:23
- Lets go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
75:23 - 75:27
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Lets go back and get them.
75:27 - 75:46
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
75:46 - 75:49
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
75:49 - 75:52
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
75:52 - 75:56
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
75:56 - 75:57
Red light.
75:57 - 76:00
Kaili!
76:00 - 76:12
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!
76:12 - 76:15
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
76:15 - 76:29
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
76:29 - 76:34
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
Ugh!
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
(Yells) Kaili!
78:37 - 78:39
Argh!
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
(Electric buzz)
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
(Hollers) Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
Help!
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
Where's he gone?
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
(Engine starts)
81:04 - 81:20
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
(Hollers) Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:30 - 83:32
Ringo!
83:32 - 83:34
(Dogs bark)
83:34 - 83:46
Ringo!
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
Hands up!
84:52 - 84:54
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
85:46 - 85:49
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
85:49 - 85:52
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
(Clang) ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
86:24 - 86:25
We turn our hearts to...
86:25 - 86:27
(Ringo) No!
86:27 - 86:29
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...
86:29 - 86:32
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
86:32 - 86:36
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
86:36 - 86:40
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
86:40 - 86:44
- There he is!
- It just came off!
86:44 - 86:46
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
86:46 - 86:48
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:48 - 86:52
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
86:52 - 86:55
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.

Watching Rainbows
Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big
I can't stand it

Thank You Girl
Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you

And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know, little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love

And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl

Thank you, girl, for loving me
The way that you do (Way that you do)
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true

And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl

Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you

And all I've  gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
